1. **This is the first step for cd, ls, and cat with no arguments.**  
**The working directory for this problem is "/home"**

* For the first "cd", it changes the directory to the home directory
  - This is not an error because it can be a stand alone command
* For the first "ls", it lists all files in the current directory, except for hidden files.
  - This is not an error because it can be a stand alone command
* For the first "cat", it is supposed to be used to concatenate and print files.
  - This is an ERROR because the terminal did not continue to work after this. I believe the cat command needs to have at least one file name after it.
