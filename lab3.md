# Lab Report 3
## By Jason Boenjamin
### This lab report is about Bugs and Commands (Week 5)

<br>

### Part 1 - Bugs

<br>

- ***Failure-inducing input for the ArrayExamples buggy program***

```
        @Test
        public void testReverseInPlace2(){
        int [] input1 = {1,2,3,4};
        ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{4,3,2,1},input1);
        }
```

- ***Non-failure inducing input***
```
        @Test
        public void testReverseInPlace() {
            int[] input1 = { 3 };
            ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
            assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
        }

```

- ***Output (failure inducing input test output and non-failure inducing input test output)***

- ***CODE BEFORE CHANGE***
```
  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```

- ***CODE AFTER CHANGE***
```
  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length-i-1];
      arr[arr.length-i-1] = temp;
    }
  }
```

- ***Output after code change***
![Image](CSE15_Lab3_SC3.png)

- ***Description of change***
The code before the fix would swap from the end to the beginning. The problem is that it wouldn't keep every value because it had already been swapped, this of course is the bug. The symptom is the terminal output we see. Through Junit, we see that the actual output does not match the expected output, until we fix it. To fix this, I needed to use a swap variable called *temp* in order to properly but the array list in reverse order.

### Part 2 - Researching commands

<br>

The only source I have used is the *man* page when using grep
- ***Command 1, two examples***
```

- As shown above, using the `grep -rn` command recursively searches through the given directory and returns the line number where it found the given string. In this case, the given string is "taxes". As you can see there's only one instance in "biomed" and many instances in the "government" directory. I can see this being exceptionally useful for finding signatures, given a name.

- As shown above, the use of `grep -rm` followed by the number of lines will search for the given string through the given directory recursively, for that specific number of lines. The output shows the working directory, followed by the entire line that word is in. For the first one, I made it check for "taxes" within the first 10 lines of the working directory for `./technical/government`. For the next one, I made it search through 5 lines for the word "DNA microarrays' in the working directory `./technical/biomed`.
